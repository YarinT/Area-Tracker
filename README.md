# Area-Tracker
### **Area Tracker for LLHZ training areas!**


**website is up and running on http://training.skyatc.live/**
<br>
For aircraft data, The website is using a JSON file fetched from a Raspberry pi with piaware installed.
This way we can use the Callsigns, altitude and transponder codes from the JSON, And match them to the areas.
<br>
### New features on version 1.2:
- Added new photo API to set the area div background as an image from Jetphotos.
- New "not-clear" color.
- Text color will change to white when the area is in use.
- app.js reorganization.

<br>
Special thanks to @EilonK05 and @OmriHirsch for their contribution.
